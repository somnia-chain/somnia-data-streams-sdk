# 🎯 SCOPING: Explicitly map the @somnia scope to the public npm registry.
# This ensures that packages under this scope are always fetched from/published to 
# the official registry, overriding any potential private registry settings.
@somnia:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/

# 🔑 AUTHENTICATION: Configure the authentication token for the registry.
# The '//' prefix indicates a protocol-agnostic URL (works for both http and https).
#
# ⚠️ CRITICAL NOTE: 
# The environment variable ${PUBLISH_NPM_TOKEN} is dynamically replaced by npm.
# This variable MUST be set in your CI/CD environment secrets (e.g., GitHub Secrets).
# If running locally, ensure this variable is exported in your shell, or npm commands may fail.
//registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=${PUBLISH_NPM_TOKEN}
